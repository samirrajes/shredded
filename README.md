# shredded

"shredded" is a creative coding project that uses a flowfield framework to simulate the appearance of shredded paper. This sketch dynamically links points through lines whose transparency varies with their proximity, creating a dense, interconnected pattern. The visual complexity is generated using Perlin noise, which influences both movement and connection of particles within the canvas, creating an unpredictable and organically evolving visual effect.
